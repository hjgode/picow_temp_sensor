    SI7021 - Temperature & Humidity Sensor.
    to use call the object with the i2C bus to use and the address of the sensor.
    If no address is given the default of 0x40 is used.

    To use the device, first you must import the library:
    
        from machine import Pin, I2C
        from I2C_bus_device import I2CDevice
        import SI7021
        
    then define the I2C bus the device is attached to:

        sdaPIN=machine.Pin(0)
        sclPIN=machine.Pin(1)
        i2c_bus = 0
        addr = 0x40

        i2c=machine.I2C(i2c_bus, sda=sdaPIN, scl=sclPIN, freq=400000)
    
    Will define an I2C bus on pin 0 for SDA and pin 1 for SCL. The actual pins will need to be changed
    to the specifics of your project. The i2c_bus will be designated by the pins used. A pinout
    of your pico will call the pins sda0 and scl0 for bus 0 and sda1 and scl1 for bus 1
    
    to define the sensor object we then use:

        si = SI7021.SI7021(i2c, addr)
        
    if the address is the same as the deafult the addr can be omited (so: si = SI7021.SI7021(i2c))
    you can then read the sesnore with the .measurments property. So:
    
            temperature, humidity = sht..measurements
            
    The temperature and humdity can be read independently if required using the .temperature and
    .relative_humidity properties:
    
            temperature = si.temperature
            humidity = si.humidity
